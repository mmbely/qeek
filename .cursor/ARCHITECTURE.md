# ARCHITECTURE.md

## 1. System Overview

**Purpose:** This application provides a platform for managing codebases, tickets, and team communication, integrating with GitHub for repository access and Gemini for AI-powered features.

**Key Features:**

* Codebase browsing and indexing
* Ticket management system
* Real-time chat functionality
* GitHub integration for repository access
* Gemini integration for AI assistance (potentially code generation, analysis, etc.)
* User authentication and authorization

**Technical Stack:**

* **Frontend:** React, React Router, Material UI, various UI libraries (Radix UI, React Syntax Highlighter), Firebase SDK
* **Backend:** Express.js, Firebase Functions, Firebase Admin SDK
* **Database:** Firebase Firestore
* **APIs:** REST APIs via Firebase Functions, GitHub API, Gemini API
* **State Management:** React Context API


**System Requirements:**

* Node.js and npm (for backend and frontend development)
* Firebase project
* GitHub account and application setup
* Gemini API key

**Performance Targets:**

* Sub-second response times for most API calls
* Minimal latency for real-time chat
* Efficient indexing of repositories


## 2. Architecture Design

**High-level Architecture:**

```mermaid

    subgraph Client (React App)
        A[UI Components] --> B(State Management - Context API)
        B --> C[API Requests]
        C --> D[Firebase Authentication]
    end
    D --> E{Firebase Functions}
    E --> F[Firestore Database]
    E --> G[GitHub API]
    E --> H[Gemini API]
```

**Component Structure:** (See metadata for detailed breakdown)

* Organized by feature (Auth, Chat, Codebase, Tickets, etc.)
* UI components separated from business logic and data fetching

**Data Flow:**

1. User interacts with the React frontend.
2. Frontend dispatches actions that trigger API requests to Firebase Functions.
3. Firebase Functions interact with Firestore, GitHub API, and Gemini API as needed.
4. Data is returned to the frontend and updates the application state.

**State Management:** React Context API is used for global state management.  Consider migrating to a more robust solution like Redux or Zustand as the application grows in complexity.

**API Design:** RESTful API using Firebase Functions.  Example:

```
/functions/repository-indexer // Indexes a GitHub repository
```

**Database Schema:**  Firestore document structure should be defined based on application requirements (e.g., tickets, user data, codebase metadata).

**Caching Strategy:**

* **Browser Caching:** Leverage service workers and browser caching for static assets.
* **API Caching:** Implement caching within Firebase Functions using in-memory caching or a dedicated caching service (e.g., Redis).
* **Database Caching:** Firestore has built-in caching mechanisms.


## 3. Security

* **Authentication Flow:** Firebase Authentication handles user login and signup.
* **Authorization Levels:**  Implement role-based access control using Firestore Security Rules.
* **Data Protection:** Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit.  Use Firestore Security Rules to restrict data access.
* **API Security:**  Validate all API requests, sanitize inputs, and use HTTPS.
* **Environment Security:** Store sensitive information (API keys, database credentials) securely using environment variables and Firebase secrets.

## 4. Development Practices (See metadata for some details)

* **Testing Strategy:** Implement unit, integration, and E2E tests. Aim for high test coverage.
* **Deployment Process:** Use Firebase CLI for deployment to staging and production.
* **CI/CD Pipeline:**  Set up a CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions or similar tools.

## Example Code Snippets (Illustrative)

**Firestore Security Rules:**

```
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {

    // Allow read access to public data
    match /public/{document=**} {
      allow read: if true;
    }

    // Secure user data
    match /users/{userId} {
      allow read, update: if request.auth.uid == userId;
    }
  }
}
```

**Firebase Functions (Express.js):**

```javascript
const functions = require("firebase-functions");
const express = require("express");
const cors = require("cors");

const app = express();
app.use(cors({ origin: true }));

app.get("/hello", (req, res) => {
  res.send("Hello from Firebase!");
});

exports.api = functions.https.onRequest(app);

```
